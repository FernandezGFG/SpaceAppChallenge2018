# GEOEXPLORER

## DESCRIPTION

GeoExplorer is a web application developed for the Space Apps Challenge 2018 that allows the visualization of open data from NASA and other institutions. The goal is to explore the Earth and promote environmental awareness through the use of world maps and globes.

## ABOUT GEOEXPLORER

GeoExplorer is a user-friendly web app that shows a world map in which the user can see events such as earthquakes and wildfires (current and past) as well as different layers with information about average temperature, clouds, snow and ice, ocean depth and a fabulous true-color view of the Earth.

The main goal is to provide the user a comfortable and intuitive experience to visualize updated data referred to our planet. Also there is a real-time calculation of the current position of several notable satellites including the ISS. While not enabled on this version, it is possible to let the user choose which satellites they want to track

## ABOUT THE EVENT

Space Apps Challenge 2018 was a collaboration event focused on space explotoration that  on October 19-21 simultanously on over 180 cities around the world.

This app was developed in the Mendoza local event which took place in the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional - Facultad Regional Mendoza

## FURTHER WORK

* Provide links to fundraising campaigns to help the affected victims of the disasters shown in the globe (earthquake, wildfires, etc.) While this not the main purpose of the it can become a tool to link the victims with the people willing to help. This could grow up organically into a more sophisticated global disaster-tracking app that pursues that goal.
* Show information about all the 
* Let the user decide which satellite wants to see or track. Calculate and visualize orbits. 
* In the mobile app notify the user if he wants to know that any satellite is passing through and calculate where to look (azimuth and elevation)
* Design own 3D models or animations for satellites, meteorites and natural disasters markers
