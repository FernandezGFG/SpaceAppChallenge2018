## FURTHER WORK

* Provide links to fundraising campaigns to help the affected victims of the disasters shown in the globe (earthquake, wildfires, etc.) While this not the main purpose of the it can become a tool to link the victims with the people willing to help. This could grow up organically into a more sophisticated global disaster-tracking app that pursues that goal.
* 
* Let the user decide which satellite wants to see or track. Calculate and visualize orbits. 
* In the mobile app notify the user if he wants to know that any satellite is passing through and calculate where to look (azimuth and elevation)
